# Responsive-WEB-page proje

I recently attended a Front-end Bootcamp that introduced me to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, sparking a deep excitement for web development. Inspired by this experience, I conducted further research to deepen my understanding of these technologies.

This project I prepared after Is Software Right for Me? Front-End Bootcamp Patika.dev. This journey has solidified my interest in the dynamic field of front-end web development, motivating me to explore it further.
